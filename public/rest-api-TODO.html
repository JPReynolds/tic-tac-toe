To start a game:

    gameId is a string of random alphanumeric e.g. x82hj3kls9d

    method:         PUT
    endpoint:       /games/{gameId}/player1
    content-type:   text/plain
    content:        player's name

    returns:

        response code: 202
        header (location): /games/{gameId}


To check if someone has joined as player 2, poll the for the game state:

    method:         GET
    endpoint:       /games/{gameId}

    returns if the game is waiting for player 2:

        response code:  200
        content-type:   text/json
        content:        { player1: "dave", player2: null }

    or if the game has already begun:

        response code:  200
        content-type:   text/json
        content:        { player1: "dave", player2: "paul", board: "         ", state: "ready" }

    or if the gameId is wrong:

        response code:  404

    "state" can also be "draw" or "win"


To join a game as player 2:

    method:         PUT
    endpoint:       /games/{gameId}/player2
    content-type:   text/plain
    content:        player's name

    returns:

        response code: 202
        header (location): /games/{gameId}

    or, if there is already a different player 2

        response code:  409
        content-type:   text/plain
        content:        Another player has already joined this game.

    or if the gameId doesn't represent a game that exists:

        response code:  404
